# 🍅 AI-Based Tomato Plant Disease Detection Using Hybrid CNNs

This project is an AI-powered image classification system that detects diseases in tomato plant leaves using a **Hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. It aims to support farmers and agronomists in identifying plant diseases early and improving crop yield through quick diagnosis.
